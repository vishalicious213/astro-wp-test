		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>[2019.01.26]</p>
		<p>I haven't coded since the mid-1990s.</p>
		<p>In 1985, when I was finishing 5th grade, my family got an Apple IIgs computer. After playing games on it (Ultima V was incredible) and writing school papers using Bank Street Writer Plus, I discovered AppleSoft BASIC and taught myself how to use it. We didnâ€™t have blank disks at the time, so I made text games from scratch, and they were lost to time every night, when we turned the computer off.</p>
		<p>Later on, I mail-ordered a board called a PC Transporter, which was essentially a DOS emulator. We discovered the wide world of PC games, and PC-DOS. A few years later, we got an actual 286 computer and fully moved away from Apple and on to PC. It came with MS-DOS. I taught myself batch programming, largely because we needed to know it to properly play games back then.</p>
