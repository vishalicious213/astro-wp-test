# To do:

- Optimize pagination

## Done

- Style the blog post pages
    - Make a layout for the blog posts
- Bring in some Pages from WP
    - Make a layout for the pages
- Add a navigation menu (desktop)
- Add a burger menu (mobile)
- Add pagination to the gallery page / index
- Make fallback image work in gallery for posts with no featured image
- Clean up the Unicode from the blog posts on their pages
    - This is harder than it seems, its probably WP sending Latin-1 text instead of UTF-8
    - Not sure why its working now, could be adding prerender to [slug]
